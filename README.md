BaltimoreCityData
=================

The file cameras2.json has Baltimore City's crime cameras, those that blink blue and reside atop etlephone poles overlooking intersections usually. 

The file Baltimore_Fixed_Speed_Cameras is a geojson of Baltimore's speed/traffic cameras. 

Both are derived from CSVs downloaded from Baltimore City's open gov site. Used pyshp and json packages in python to manipulate the city data into geojson format.
